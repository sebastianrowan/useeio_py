### Validate that commodity output can be recalculated (within 1%) with the model total requirements matrix (L) and demand vector (y) for US production

```r
econval <- compareOutputandLeontiefXDemand(model, tolerance = 0.01)
cat(paste("Number of sectors passing:",econval$N_Pass))

Sectors with flow totals failing: S00402/US, S00300/US

### Validate that commodity output equals to domestic use plus production demand

```r
q_val <- compareCommodityOutputandDomesticUseplusProductionDemand(model, tolerance = 0.01)
cat(paste("Number of flow totals by commodity passing:",q_val$N_Pass))
```

Number of flow totals by commodity passing: 404
